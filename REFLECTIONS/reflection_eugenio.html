    <h2>Web Development (WS01-02)</h2>

    <div class="meta">
        <p>Name: NICOLE GRACE S. EUGENIO</p>
        <p>Course: Web Systems and Technologies</p>
        <p>Instructor: Glenn Christoper Avellino</p>

    <p>The Web Development (WS01-02) was a great introduction to the basics of building and designing websites. Before taking this subject, I had a limited understanding of what web development involved. I thought it was mostly just writing code to make things appear on a webpage, but through this lesson, I realized it is a much more structured and creative process.</p>

    <p>One of the first key lessons was understanding the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web. I used to use those terms interchangeably, but now I know the Internet is the massive network that connects devices worldwide, while the Web is a service that operates over the Internet using protocols like HTTP. This clarification helped me better understand how websites actually function and how data travels between computers.</p>

    <p>The module also introduced HTML and CSS, which are the foundation of web design. I learned how HTML is used to structure content and how CSS is applied to style that content. It was interesting to see how even small changes in CSS can completely change the appearance of a webpage. We explored different ways to apply CSS (inline, internal, and external), and I learned that using external CSS is the most organized method, especially for larger projects.</p>

    <p>Another important part of the lesson was learning about the different types of websites and the tools used for web development. This included text editors, source code editors, and web browsers, which are all essential for the development process.</p>

    <p>One of the most eye-opening sections was the Web Development Life Cycle (WDLC). I realized that web development is not just about aesthetics, but also about planning, analysis, implementation, testing, publishing, and maintenance. This helped me see the bigger picture of how websites are professionally built and maintained.</p>

    <p>I also found the topic on semantic and non-semantic elements really useful. Tags like <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> help define the purpose of content, making the code more readable and accessible to both developers and search engines.</p>

    <p>Responsive design was another highlight. I learned how to use media queries, Flexbox, and CSS Grid to ensure that websites adapt to different screen sizes. It made me realize how important it is to think about user experience, not just the visual layout.</p>

    <p>Overall, this module gave me a solid foundation in web development. It helped me understand both the technical and logical aspects of building websites. I'm now more confident in my ability to start small projects and excited to continue learning more advanced techniques in the future.</p>
