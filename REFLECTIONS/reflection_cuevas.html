         Learning about RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color combinations in HTML has been a fascinating journey that deepened my appreciation for how websites are visually designed. Before diving into this topic, I saw color in web design as something straightforward. However, working with RGB values revealed the complex and creative process behind digital color blending.        </p>

          When I first began learning HTML, I expected it to be simple—just a matter of writing tags and adding text. However, as I got deeper into HTML programming, I quickly realized it came with its own set of challenges that required patience, problem-solving, and attention to detail.        </p>

         Looking back on my journey with learning HTML code, there are several things I realize I could have done differently to make the process smoother and more effective. HTML, the language used to create the structure of web pages, is powerful and essential for anyone interested in web development. Although I did make progress, reflecting on my experience shows me where I could have improved.

         As the world becomes more digital every day, learning how to create and understand websites has become an essential skill. One of the things I want to learn in the future is HTML coding. HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of all web pages. It allows us to structure content on the internet, such as text, images, videos, and links.
          <em>and</em> work smoothly is a double win. Plus, getting better at
          PHP and SQL would help me become a full-stack wizard, capable of
          summoning both front-end beauty and back-end brains.

          HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of the internet. As I reflect on what I’ve learned and experienced with HTML coding, I realize just how important it is in today’s digital world. Every web page starts with HTML—it structures the content, organizes information, and allows users to interact with websites in meaningful ways.
