    <p> In our project, in making poocafe, my main role was testing. I didn’t do much coding, but I tried my best to check if everything was working properly. One thing I noticed was that the login form allowed users to enter an email without the “@” symbol, which shouldn't happen. At first, I thought maybe I was wrong, but after trying it a few times, I realized it was actually a bug. Even though the form used <code>type="email"</code>, it still let invalid emails through. It made me realize how even simple-looking forms can have problems that aren’t obvious unless you really test them.</p>

    <p> Since I’m not very familiar with JavaScript or advanced coding, it was a bit hard for me to understand why the email field wasn’t validating properly. But I took the time to look at the HTML, and I saw that the email input had the right type and a placeholder, but it still let me log in with just random text. I asked for help from my group and we talked about how sometimes browsers don’t catch everything. That helped me understand that testing isn’t just about finding bugs—it’s about asking questions and being curious, even if you’re not the one writing the code.</p>

    <p> If I had more experience, maybe I could’ve tested more things, like checking how the form works in different browsers or trying different types of inputs. I also wish I had kept a list of what I tested so I could share it better with the group. But for now, I’m just glad I caught that one issue. Even though I don’t know JavaScript or anything advanced, I learned that being observant is already a big help.</p>

    <p> I don’t really have big goals yet when it comes to coding, but I do want to slowly learn more about how things work—especially how to make websites catch errors better. Maybe someday I’ll understand a bit of JavaScript, but for now I just want to get better at spotting issues and understanding the basics of how websites work.</p>

    <p> Even though I wasn’t one of the main developers in the group, I still felt like I contributed by helping find a bug. Testing might seem like a small job, but it really showed me how important it is. If no one checks the little details, users might end up with a broken experience. I may not know much yet, but this project helped me realize that even small efforts can make a difference in a team project.</p>
