          Doing the Poocafe case study helped me learn how to build a website using HTML and CSS. I learned how to put text, images, and styles together to make a coffee-themed webpage. It was fun to see the website come to life as we worked on it. I also learned the importance of design, like choosing the right colors and layout to make the page look good.

          We had some problems while working on the project. One of the hardest parts was making sure the website looked good on both computers and phones. Sometimes the layout would break, and we had to fix it using CSS and media queries. The code also got messy, but we cleaned it up and organized it better so it was easier to work with.

          If I had more time and skills, I would have added some extra features like animations or buttons that do something. I also would have made the site more accessible by using the right tags and adding things like image descriptions. I think the design could have looked more professional with a few more changes.

           I want to learn more about how to make websites work better and look more modern. Studying JavaScript will help me add cool features like sliders, pop-ups, and dynamic content. I’m also interested in learning about design tools and better layout techniques to improve the look and user experience of my websites. Exploring new technologies will help me become a more skilled and confident web developer.

          Through this project, I discovered a lot and gained more confidence in my ability to build websites. While there were tough moments along the way, I found the experience enjoyable and motivating. It made me even more excited to continue exploring and growing my web development skills.
